## Motivation

At INSEA, we recognize that our curriculum is heavy on computer science theory, leaving limited room for hands-on experience. But we believe that true understanding comes from applying what we've learned. That's why our Open Source Initiative is designed to bridge this gap, allowing students to turn theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world solutions.

We invite you to be part of our mission to transform this community into a leading hub for open source in our Institute. Together, we can cultivate a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous growth that benefits all. Whether you’re an experienced developer or just embarking on your journey, there’s a place for you here. Let’s learn, evolve, and create together.

Welcome to the INSEA Open Source Realm, where we transcend theoretical boundaries and immerse ourselves in real-world challenges.
